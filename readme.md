Streamlit is a Python-based framework used to build data-driven web applications.
It is not built on top of React directly, but it uses modern frontend technologies internally to render UI components in the browser.

Compared to Flask, Streamlit requires very little backend or web development knowledge.
In Flask, developers must handle routing, HTML templates, CSS, and JavaScript manually, whereas Streamlit allows building applications using only Python.

One limitation of Streamlit is customization.
Unlike Flask or React-based applications, Streamlit offers fewer options for deep UI customization and complex frontend control.
